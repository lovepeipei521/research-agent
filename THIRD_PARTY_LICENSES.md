## Adaptation notes

Adapted skills have been modified from their originals:

- Frontmatter normalized to this project's schema (`name` / `description` /
  `allowed-tools` / `enabled` / `related-skills` / `license` / `author`).
- Tool references remapped to this project's tool set
  (`terminal` → `bash`, `search_files` → `grep`, `patch` → `str_replace`,
  `web_extract`/`web_search` → `web_search`, `read_file` → `read_file`,
  `find`/`ls` → `list_dir`, `cat`/`head`/`tail` → `read_file`).
- Project-specific paths rewritten (`.hermes/` → `.poirot/`).
- Hermes-private frontmatter fields (`metadata.hermes.*`, `platforms`,
  `version`) dropped or converted to this project's equivalents.

Original skill content is preserved under each skill directory's `SKILL.md`
with the `author` field crediting the source project. See the upstream
repositories for the unmodified originals.
